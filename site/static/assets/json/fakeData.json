Say goodbye to *trolls*, say goodbye to *spammers*, say goodbye to *pervates* with Hope's automatic moderation system!\n\nThis isn't all Hope can offer you. Hope also manages to announce new broadcasts on **Twitch and Youtube** (*Live and Videos*), as well as *subreddit posts* on **Reddit**. Make your server an attractive place with Hope!\n\nDo you think that's all? No! Hope is also able to **announce birthdays** of the day on a specific channel with its **Birthdays addon**.\n\nOh! How about an **advanced suggestion** system? Of course Hope has one! Allow members of your server to leave *suggestions and vote* for a specific channel with Hope.\n\nIt's a lot of good stuff, right? Did I mention the advanced **Ticket system**? Well, I guess I better stop here and let you find out all this for yourself, right?\n\n\n# Features\n\nHope is available in 13 languages: `English`, `Portuguese - Brazil`, `French`, `Thai`, `Italian`, `German`, `Spanish, Spain`, `Russian`, `Chinese Simplified`, `Korean`, `Polish`, `Japanese`, `Dutch` and is always willing to learn a new one!\n\n|ADDON                |DESCRIPTION                         |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|Applications|`Addon to create application forms on your server.`       |\n|Auto-Animes|`Announcement addon for when an anime goes live.`\n|Auto-Mod          |`Keep your server in control, avoid spam, raids, nsfw content and more!`\n|Auto-Covid          |`Auto-Posting Addon for updated information on covid-19 every 1 hour.`|\n|Auto-Response          |`Automatically respond to text triggers.`|\n|Auto-Twitch          |`Notifications when streamers go online`|\n|Auto-Youtube          |`Subscribe to a Youtube channel and receive notifications when it posts a new video!`|\n|Auto-Reddit          |`Subscribe to a subreddit and receive notifications when there are new posts!`|\n|Auto-Nick          |`Change the user's nickname to a pre-set when you join the server.`|\n|Auto-Message          |`Automatically post timed messages in a channel.`|\n|Birthdays          |`Wish user's birthdays in a pre-defined channel.`|\n|Level          |`Level Management Addon`|\n|Moderation          |`Enabled moderation commands and mod log.`|\n|Suggestion          |`Allow members to offer suggestions on a specific channel`|\n|System          |`Manage the main Hope system settings.`|\n|Reputation          |`Addon of Reputations integrated into the profile and with ranking.`|\n|Ticket          |`Addon allowing your uses to create tickets on your server.`|\n|Verification (ANTI-RAID)          |`Verification Addon protects your server against RAIDs.`|\n|Reaction Roles          |`Allow members to self-assign roles by reacting.`|\n\nIn addition, Hope has `13` categories of commands totaling more than `300` commands.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo add Hope to your server, you must first meet a few requirements:\n### Have at least `10` HUMAN users\n_Ahhh.... come on... It's only 10 people, it's not a big number, right? And besides, this is a minimum requirement for server validation_\n\n### Don't have more `BOTS` than HUMAN users!\n_Seriously, that's not a cool thing to see..._\n\n> Hope is a bot that took many months to develop and is still in constant development with almost daily updates, with over 300 commands, 12 different categories and over 19 addons... and it was all developed by one person. This system was made to allow only people who really want to use Hope, use it. <3\nSo Hope will be leaving this server... since he doesn't have the necessary requirements to keep it. But do not be sad, you can add it here again when you reach the requirements said above, or if you have another server that already meets these requirements, you can then add it there.\n\n# Info\n\n- Join our [support server](https://discord.com/invite/RC5dmwVapP \"support server\") if you need help, want to get information about updates and issues or want to offer contributions to Hope!\n\n- Invite Hope to your server [by clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=901243176814276680&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=261993005047 \"by clicking here\") and make it a SUPER COOL SERVER.\n\n- Visit [Hope's website](https://hopebot.xyz/) to set up your server.\n\nAnd feel free to check out our [Privacy Policy](https://hopebot.xyz/privacy-policy) and our [Terms of Service](https://hopebot.xyz/terms-of-service).",
